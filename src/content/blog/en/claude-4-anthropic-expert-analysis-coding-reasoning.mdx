## Revolutionary Capabilities: What Truly Distinguishes Claude 4

Beyond raw performance improvements, Claude 4 introduces a set of innovative features that significantly expand its scope and practical utility.

### Autonomous Coding and Claude Code

Opus 4, and to a large extent Sonnet 4, demonstrate exceptional coding capabilities. **Claude Code**, now generally available, is an agentic tool that integrates with VS Code, JetBrains (beta), and GitHub Actions. It offers an extensible SDK to automate complex programming tasks, from code generation and refactoring to debugging. Opus 4's ability to manage development projects over several hours illustrates this shift towards greater autonomy.

### Augmented Reasoning with "Extended Thinking"

Both models can engage in an iterative reasoning process, termed "extended thinking." They can use tools, such as web search (in beta), to refine their analyses and responses. For long processes, "thinking summaries" are provided for clarity, with a developer mode offering full access to the reasoning path. This approach allows Claude 4 to tackle problems requiring deliberation and in-depth exploration.

### Advanced Tool Use and Code Execution

Claude 4 stands out for its ability to interact with external tools and execute code:

*   **Parallel Tool Execution:** Enhances efficiency in managing multiple tasks involving different tools.
*   **Python Code Execution Tool (API):** Enables Claude to produce computational results, data visualizations, and analyze datasets directly, without manual user intervention to run the code.
*   **Computer Use (Beta):** A promising feature where Claude 4 can interact with a virtual desktop environment (controlling mouse, keyboard, screen captures) to automate digital tasks.
*   **MCP Connector (Model Context Protocol):** Simplifies connection to remote MCP servers (e.g., Zapier, Asana) without requiring specific client-side code, facilitating third-party tool integration.

### Enhanced Memory and Files API

Context and information management are crucial for complex tasks:

*   **Local File Access:** Allows Claude to manage extended contexts by accessing user-provided files, thereby building "tacit knowledge" for continuous interactions.
*   **Files API:** Simplifies document storage and access for persistent interactions, particularly useful for applications needing to work with large corpora.

### Multimodal Understanding (Vision)

Claude 4 maintains and improves the vision capabilities introduced with Claude 3. It can analyze images (charts, graphs, photos) up to 5MB (API) or 10MB (claude.ai), supporting JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP formats. This opens the door to extracting information from visual sources.

### Multilingual Proficiency

Claude 4 models exhibit high performance in numerous languages, often exceeding 95% of the English-language performance on benchmarks like MMLU. This ensures global reach and utility for a diverse user base.

## Performance and Benchmarks: Claude 4 Against the Competition

Anthropic positions Claude 4 زيتleading on several benchmarks, particularly those evaluating coding and complex reasoning capabilities.

| **MMLU (no reflection)**        | 87.4%                                   | 85.4%                                     | GPT-4o (88.7%), Gemini 1.5 Pro (83.7%)                   |
| **MMMU (no reflection)**        | 73.7%                                   | 72.6%                                     | Gemini 2.0 Pro (72.7%)                                   |

These figures, especially the high scores on **SWE-bench** (which assesses the ability to solve real-world software engineering problems), underscore Claude 4's power. Companies like Rakuten have validated Opus 4's robustness on seven-hour code refactoring tasks, confirming its endurance and reliability for large-scale projects.
