          "question": "How much does MVP development cost?",
          "answer": "MVP cost ranges from €6,000 to €15,000 depending on complexity. Our transparent approach gives you a precise estimate from the first exchange. The price includes design, development, testing and deployment."
        },
        "difference": {
          "question": "What's the difference between POC, prototype and MVP?",
          "answer": "A POC (Proof of Concept) validates technical feasibility. A prototype is an interactive mockup without backend. An MVP is a functional product with essential features, ready to be used by real users. We focus on MVPs because they allow real market validation."
        },
        "features": {
          "question": "How to choose my MVP features?",
          "answer": "Our Vision-First approach guides you to identify essential features. We use the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to prioritize. The goal: solve your users' main problem with minimum features."
        },
        "patent": {
          "question": "Should I patent my idea before developing an MVP?",
          "answer": "In most cases, no. A patent is expensive and takes time to obtain. We systematically sign an NDA to protect your idea. The important thing is to launch quickly to validate the market. You can patent later if necessary."
        },
        "timeline": {
          "question": "Why 2-3 weeks for an MVP?",
          "answer": "This optimal timeframe allows quality development without rushing thanks to AI. Week 1: Vision Workshop and architecture. Week 2: AI-powered intensive development. Week 3: Testing, adjustments and deployment. A shorter timeline would compromise quality."
        },
        "technologies": {
          "question": "What technologies do you use for MVP Development?",
          "answer": "We use modern and proven technologies: React/Next.js for frontend, Node.js/Python for backend, PostgreSQL/MongoDB for database. The exact choice depends on your specific needs. All are open-source to avoid vendor lock-in."
        },
        "ownership": {
          "question": "Do I own the code of my MVP?",
          "answer": "Yes, 100%. Upon delivery, you receive all source code, documentation and access. You can modify it, evolve it with other developers or resell it. No license, no restrictions."
        },
        "support": {
          "question": "What support after MVP delivery?",
          "answer": "30-day warranty is included to fix any bugs. Beyond that, we offer maintenance plans or our Evolution Partnership for continuous support. You remain free to manage maintenance internally or with other providers."
